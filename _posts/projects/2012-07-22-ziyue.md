ZiYue (Chinese name: 子曰) is a Web 2.0 SNS website. It is developed using ASP .NET. The back end is written in C# and the front end is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript. We use SQL Server 2012 as our storage system.

The core functionalities of ZiYue include:

*   User management
    *   Account management
    *   Profile update
    *   Following/unfollowing
    *   Status update
*   Circles (user interest groups)
    *   Publishing/replying posts
*   Online Q&A platform
    *   Answer voting

We developed the website using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. We used Enterprise Architect to aid architecture design. The whole system is divided into 3 layers:

*   Presentation Layer (the website)
*   Business Logic Layer
*   Data Access Layer

ZiYue is a course project for *Practice of Programming* (Course Number: 34100152) at Tsinghua University in summer 2012. The team members are: Jinghong Situ, Yuqi Wang, and Heran Lin.
