Acknowledgments
===============

This website could not have existed without the awesome projects mentioned below.

The website is generated by [Jekyll][], a powerful static site generator written in Ruby.

[Sass][] and [Compass][] aid me  greatly as I design the theme of the website, alleviating the burden of writing lengthy CSS rules and handling cross-browser compatibility. [Susy][] makes the responsive layout possible for my website.

The fonts I use are from [Google Fonts][], and the cute icons from [Font Awesome][] have decorated my site. The background image of this web page is from [Subtle Patterns][].

The site is proudly hosted by [GitHub][] currently.
