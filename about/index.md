About Me
========

I am Heran Lin, an undergraduate student from School of Software, Tsinghua University. I was previously a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia.

I am always seeking to write clean and elegant code. I believe programming can be an elegant way to describe and change the real world.

I love painting. I am fascinated by beautiful designs which are visually and emotionally pleasing. In my spare time I like reading books, and I am quite interested in psychology and the history of philosophy.

My personal email address is revealed by the following Python code. Feel free to contact me (if you are a human, or if you are a robot able to understand the line below) !

~~~python
email = ''.join(['linhr10', chr(64), 'gmail.com'])
