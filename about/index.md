About Me
========

My name is Heran Lin. I am a graduate student at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, studying in the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) program. I received my bachelor's degree in computer software from Tsinghua University in 2014.

I am interested in machine learning and data mining. I love clean and elegant code as well as beautiful UI design. I am always trying to build software systems for real-world problems. In my spare time I like reading books, and I am quite interested in psychology and the history of philosophy.

My personal email address is revealed by the following Python code. Feel free to contact me (even if you are a robot, as long as you can understand the line below) !
